# Recreation Golden Sun
Recreating mechanics from Golden Sun, & Golden Sun: The Lost Age for educational purposes, to improve my skills as a game programmer.
</br>
Developed primarily with controller support in mind, in **Unreal 5.3**

Apart from the games themselves, the fandom wiki is used to quickly get information that would otherwise be a hassle to get hold of.
</br>
The information is then crosschecked against the games, to check that I have correctly implemented it.

### Challenges
* Adapting to an engine with little prior experience
* Unreal's UI system
* Wrapping my head around the many different pieces that make up the combat system
  

### Future plans
* Add features that are missing from the combat system (i.e. summons, items, combat text, status effects, etc.)
* Create a tool for easy handling of level and stat growth
* Create the basis of the overworld
* Create debug UI for overworld and combat respectively
* Including more
</br>
</br>

## COMBAT SYSTEM
I aim to create a combat system as close to Golden Sun's as I can, while also making tools that ease the creation of more generic functionalities, i.e. stat growth. </br>
The combat system has a lot of interconnected parts, such as the djinn system being connected to both the class system and summon mechanic, making it a challenge to have everything mesh together well.
